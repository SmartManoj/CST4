This version is reworked to address issues where Sublime would hang when opening new browser windows. The format for the sublime-settings file is also new and more compact and efficient. Please note that if you had any customization against this they may no longer function. User settings files may need to be redone against the new format. 

I apologize for any inconvenience and thank you for using View In Browser!
